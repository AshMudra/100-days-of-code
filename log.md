# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - ASH MUDRA

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on July 1, Friday, 2022.

### Day 1: July 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on 2 Algo Expert problems

**Thoughts:** I was way more motivated to do anything else today. I procrastinated until the end of the day and was so tired by the time I started coding. Not a great way to do my first hour. But I stuck to it. It's clear that I need to do my hour earlier in the day before I'm exhausted. It was also a little discouraging how long it took me to work through an easy problem. But I guess that's why I'm practicing!

### Day 2: July 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked through 2 Algo Expert problems and answered a JS question on the FreeCodeCamp forum (which took me coding and checking)

**Thoughts**: I did my hour earlier than yesterday, but it was still late afternoon and so it was hanging over my head for most of the day. My brain was working a little faster and I understood the problems I solved. Tomorrow I'll try to do my hour first thing. I also need to NOT look at social media and leave my phone in another room. FOCUS!
